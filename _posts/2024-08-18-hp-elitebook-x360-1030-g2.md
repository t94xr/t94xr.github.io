## UEFI BIOS Upgrade

### Windows 11

* UEFI & Secure Boot Support
* TPM 2.0 Support
* Processor Unsupported *(Intel 8th Gen minimum required, officially.)*

Windows 11 can be installed, using a tweaked installer bypassing checks - Windows 11 does provide a fully functional OOBE, no issues.

### Linux

The power key is easy to hit by accident. If you use a desktop environment or window manager (such as awesome or qtile) without built-in power manager, pressing the power key will shutdown the computer. To avoid this:

```
In        /etc/systemd/logind.conf
change:   HandlePowerKey=poweroff
to:       HandlePowerKey=suspend
```

## Ex-Lease / Used Review

These units are affordable, depending on condition you're looking at [$200-400](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=Elitebook+x360+1030+G2&_sacat=0) *USD*, with [Windows 10 going out of support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro) in late 2025, these will leave the "supported" Windows scene, entering a life of potentially ewaste, if not still being useful as a system running Linux, giving it a second life.

Disabling the Fingerprint Reader, NFC reader and SmartCard slot, this laptop is still a fully functional powerful system. Still being an ex-lease system, it may need a new SSD and/or battery which can be purchased fairly cheaply and both can installed relatively easily by most users with a basic screwdriver kit.
